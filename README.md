# Nifty - React Native NFT Project

Nifty is a small React Native project focused on NFTs. It features searching functionality, two main screens for NFT cards and placing bids, a current bid section, a description with a "Read More" and "Show Less" function, and a favorite button. The project utilizes React Navigation for smooth navigation between screens.

## Screens

### 1. NFT Cards Screen

This screen displays a collection of NFT cards, each showcasing unique digital assets. Users can browse through the available NFTs, view their details, and mark their favorites.

### 2. Placing a Bid Screen

On this screen, users can place bids on their chosen NFTs. The interface includes a section showing the current bids, allowing users to participate in the auction.

## Features

- **Searching Functionality:** Users can search for specific NFTs based on criteria such as name, artist, or category.
- **Read More/Show Less:** Long descriptions are truncated with a "Read More" button, providing users with the option to expand or collapse the content.
- **Favorite Button:** Users can mark NFTs as favorites for easy access and tracking.
- **React Navigation:** Seamless navigation between the NFT Cards and Placing a Bid screens.
